# React + TypeScript + Axios + TailWind

In this project, the following were used:

TypeScript for prop checking.
Tailwind CSS for styling.
Axios for API calls. It was preferred over the internal JavaScript fetch due to browser compatibility and for the future use of interceptors that it offers as a feature.
In React, useState was used for creating state, useEffect for side effects, specifically for communication with the API, and useContext for creating a context for the use of the modal.
